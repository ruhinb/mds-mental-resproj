Project Objectives

Part A — Beyond Blue Conversations
	1.	Detect early signals of depressive and anxiety-related symptoms from online mental health discussions.
	2.	Explore emotional and cognitive patterns in conversations through large language models and network analysis.
	3.	Examine how users’ mental states change over time within community interactions.


Part B — Climate Overlay
	1.	Investigate the relationship between natural disaster events and mental health expressions in Beyond Blue posts.
	2.	Compare emotional and linguistic signals across pre-event, during-event, and post-event phases.
	3.	Identify broader patterns of mental health signal shifts across different disaster types.


Expanded

Part A — Beyond Blue Conversations (Baseline Analysis)
	1.	Flatten and integrate user interactions by transforming original posts and comments into a single dataset where every text unit (post or comment) is treated as an entry, linked by user_id and parent_post_id.
	2.	Detect early depressive and anxiety-related signals by applying emotion mapping (Circumplex Model of Affect) and psycholinguistic tools (LIWC, DLATK) to all text units, capturing valence, arousal, and linguistic markers.
	3.	Apply LLMs, psycholinguistic features, and network analysis on the enriched dataset to identify cognitive and emotional patterns, including bridge symptoms that connect different mental health conditions (e.g., insomnia linking anxiety and depression).
	4.	Conduct temporal analysis to track how individual users’ emotional states evolve over time, highlighting trajectories of deterioration, improvement, or stability across conversations.


Part B — Climate Overlay (Event-Based Analysis)
	1.	Focus on original posts only, excluding comments, to create a clean dataset for climate analysis.
	2.	Re-run emotion and linguistic mapping (valence–arousal via Circumplex, LIWC/DLATK features) on these original posts.
	3.	Align posts with natural disaster events using event start and end dates, classifying posts into pre-event, during-event, and post-event phases.
	4.	Aggregate and compare emotional and linguistic signals across phases to explore whether climate events are associated with changes in posting activity, emotional tone, or symptom markers.
	5.	Summarize event-level patterns across disaster types (e.g., floods, bushfires, storms) to identify which events are most strongly correlated with shifts in mental health signals.
